# BI-Big-Data-FinTech

My goal in this project is to create programs that help the user perform basic business analytics. Given that my major is economics and my minor is computer science and statistics, 
I wanted to create a program that would have direct application to the role that I may take on in the employment world. My program might perform basic accounting task such as 
storing a spreadsheet's worth of information in an array while allowing the user to access specific information upon request. Moreover, I would use some of the math functions 
of Java to provide the user with basic movement-over-time analysis using inputs of monthly and/or yearly revenue. I want to explore this topic of business intelligence because 
I feel as if there is a growing market for people who possess the skills to improve a companies practices using machine learning and AI support.
